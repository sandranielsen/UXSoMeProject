</p>

<h4 class="faq_question">When is deadline for applying for a top up programme? </h4>
<p class="subsection_paragraph">The deadline is July 1 at 12.00 midday for summer start and December 1 at 12.00 midday for winter start. You apply via the application form on our website.</p>

<h4 class="faq_question">What kind of documents do I have to upload to apply for a top up?</h4>
<p class="subsection_paragraph">You just upload the diploma from your AP degree along with the application form – that’s it!</p>

<h4 class="faq_question">What are the admission requirements for international students? </h4>
<p class="subsection_paragraph"> Non-Danish applicants must apply for admission on the same terms as Danish applicants. You are eligible for admission if you have either a Danish qualifying examination or qualifications recognised or assessed as being comparable to the Danish entrance qualifications.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"><br><br>All applicants must have a certificate proving adequate qualifications in English at an upper level which is comparable to English level B of a Danish upper secondary examination. <br>
This means that international applicants must have had English for at least 210 hours during the last three years of their upper-secondary education (classes of less than 60 minutes, must be converted into whole hours)</span>
